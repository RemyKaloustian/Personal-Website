                              What I liked the most during this project was the exchange with my teammates (two graphic designers).
                              It was back then that I realized that working in a team stimulates me. I found all the discussions
                              enriching and relevant. I finally developed a working game basis, with mini-games, a shop (not with real money),
                               dynamic creatures animation (change depending on the creature's state), a tutorial and an experience system."
